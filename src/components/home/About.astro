                    "I noticed a gap. The local market was flooded with
                    retailers selling products, not visions. They offered
                    furniture. I wanted to offer a lifestyle."

                    By Shakir was born from a desire to bring the "International
                    Hotel Vibe" to the Gelderland region. Merging the brutalist
                    elegance of Dubai architecture with the warmth of high-end
                    hospitality, we create spaces that don't just look
                    expensive—they feel important.
